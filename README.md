# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project has been a really enjoyable learning experience.
I learned the following while working on this project: 
1. I learned about the minimax algorithm and how to use it to make a smart player in tic tac toe.
2. I learned how to use factory functions and modules (IIFE), or Immediately Invoked Function Expressions to simplify my code and make it more organized.
3. I learned, and I am still learning, the importance of organizing my code in a logical manner such that it is 
easy to read and understand by me in the future, and by others.
